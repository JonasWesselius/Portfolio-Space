  learningOutcome: "Through these wireframing projects, I developed a strong understanding of user interface planning and information architecture. I learned how to effectively communicate design ideas through wireframes and how to iterate on designs based on feedback. The experience taught me the importance of planning before implementation and how to create scalable design systems.",

    {
      id: "media-products",
      title: "You create engaging concepts and translate them into interactive validated media products by applying user-centered design principles, visual design techniques and by exploring emerging technologies.",
      explanation: "The wireframing projects demonstrate my ability to create engaging user interface concepts through systematic planning and user-centered design principles. I applied visual design techniques to create clear and intuitive wireframes that effectively communicate design ideas. The projects showcase my understanding of how to translate user needs into interactive interface designs."

    {
      id: "process-documentation",
      title: "You explain and document your process, comment your code using version control in a personal and team context and communicate recommendations.",
      explanation: "I maintained detailed documentation throughout the wireframing process, including design rationale, user flow diagrams, and component specifications. I used version control to track design iterations and collaborated effectively with team members. I also provided clear recommendations for implementation based on the wireframe designs."
    },
    {
      id: "iterations",
      title: "You present the successive iterations of your creative process, and the connections between them.",
      explanation: "Each wireframe went through multiple iterations based on user feedback and stakeholder input. I documented the evolution of designs, showing how each iteration improved the user experience and addressed specific requirements. The connections between iterations demonstrate a clear progression toward the final design."

      title: "Professional standard: Individually and in teams, you will apply a methodological approach used by the field to formulate project goals, involve stakeholders, conduct action-oriented research, advise, take decisions and report. In take into account ethical, intercultural and sustainable considerations.",
      explanation: "I followed industry-standard wireframing methodologies, involving stakeholders in the design process and conducting user research to inform design decisions. I considered accessibility, usability, and ethical implications in the wireframe designs. I also ensured that the designs would be sustainable and maintainable for long-term development."

  process: "The wireframing process began with thorough research and analysis of user needs and project requirements. I started by creating low-fidelity wireframes to explore different layout options and user flows. After gathering feedback from stakeholders and users, I refined the designs through multiple iterations, gradually increasing the fidelity level. I documented design decisions and created comprehensive design specifications for implementation. The final phase involved creating interactive prototypes for user testing and validation.",
