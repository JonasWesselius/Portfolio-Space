  learningOutcome: "Through this project, I developed a strong foundation in information architecture and user flow design. I learned how to create effective wireframes that communicate design intent clearly and how to iterate on designs based on feedback. This experience taught me the importance of planning before implementation and how to balance user needs with technical constraints.",
  learningOutcomes: [
    {
      id: "media-products",
      title: "You create engaging concepts and translate them into interactive validated media products by applying user-centered design principles, visual design techniques and by exploring emerging technologies.",
      explanation: "The wireframes demonstrate my ability to create engaging user interface concepts that translate into practical design solutions. I applied user-centered design principles by focusing on user needs and behaviors. The wireframes were validated through user testing and feedback, ensuring they effectively communicated the intended user experience."

    {
      id: "process-documentation",
      title: "You explain and document your process, comment your code using version control in a personal and team context and communicate recommendations.",
      explanation: "I documented the wireframing process, explaining the rationale behind each design decision. This documentation served as a valuable reference for the development team, providing clear recommendations for implementation. I used version control to track changes to the wireframes, ensuring all team members had access to the latest designs."
    },
    {
      id: "iterations",
      title: "You present the successive iterations of your creative process, and the connections between them.",
      explanation: "Each wireframe went through multiple iterations based on feedback and testing. I presented these iterations to stakeholders, explaining how each version addressed specific user needs or improved the overall experience. This transparent process helped the team understand the evolution of the design and the reasoning behind final decisions."

      id: "professional",
      title: "Professional standard: Individually and in teams, you will apply a methodological approach used by the field to formulate project goals, involve stakeholders, conduct action-oriented research, advise, take decisions and report. In take into account ethical, intercultural and sustainable considerations.",
      explanation: "I approached each wireframing project with a professional methodology, involving stakeholders throughout the process. I conducted user research to inform design decisions and considered accessibility to ensure the interfaces would be inclusive. I also took into account ethical considerations regarding user data and privacy."
