  process: "I began my internship search at the start of the semester, following advice from senior students about the importance of early preparation. Initially, I focused on developing a portfolio website similar to this one but showcasing my past work. However, as this was taking longer than anticipated, I shifted my strategy to direct applications, offering to show my work directly to interested recruiters. I utilized multiple channels: reaching out to my personal network, checking the Fontys database, posting on LinkedIn, and using various job platforms like Indeed, Stagemax, and Fiks. I had secured an internship with Prijsvrij Vakantie in Den Bosch after multiple meetings, but they canceled two weeks before the end of the semester. This unexpected turn of events has led me back to the search process, applying the lessons learned from this experience to find new opportunities.",
