      id: "media-products",
      title: "You create engaging concepts and translate them into interactive validated media products by applying user-centered design principles, visual design techniques and by exploring emerging technologies.",
      explanation: "This semester I've created several significant media products. The centerpiece is my space-themed portfolio website, built with React and featuring interactive star constellations and smooth transitions. For IMA Projects, I developed key components of our refugee integration platform, including the CV builder and job matching features. I also created comprehensive brand guidelines for our studio team 'Frontyard Boys', including logo variations and style guides. Each product was developed with user needs in mind - the portfolio focusing on recruiter accessibility, the IMA platform on refugee usability, and the brand guide on team consistency. The mockups for the IMA project evolved through multiple iterations, from basic wireframes to a full-featured PWA design. These diverse projects demonstrate my ability to create engaging, user-centered digital products across different contexts and technologies."

      id: "process-documentation",
      title: "You explain and document your process, comment your code using version control in a personal and team context and communicate recommendations.",
      explanation: "A critical lesson I learned this semester was the importance of proper version control practices. During the IMA project, we faced significant issues when team members merged directly into main without code reviews, culminating in breaking changes right before our final presentation. This experience taught me to enforce stricter Git workflows - requiring pull requests, conducting thorough code reviews, and ensuring all team members understand Git basics before touching the codebase. I took the initiative to teach team members how to use GitHub Desktop, create branches, and make proper pull requests. For my portfolio, I maintained detailed documentation of my process, from wireframes to final implementation. These experiences highlighted how crucial it is to have standardized documentation and version control practices, especially in team settings where code changes can have huge impacts."

    {
      id: "iterations",
      title: "You present the successive iterations of your creative process, and the connections between them.",
      explanation: "This semester tested me to the max when it came to my iterative process. While I aimed for frequent iterations and feedback, since in previous semesters this was also a point of improvement, personal circumstances - including my father's cancer surgery, my grandmother's hospitalization, and other family situations - limited my ability to engage in as many feedback sessions as I would have liked. Despite these constraints, I still managed to iterate effectively on key projects. My portfolio evolved from initial wireframes through multiple design phases, though feedback opportunities were more limited than ideal. The IMA project saw iterations in our mockups and features, adapting to user research despite time constraints. While I would have preferred more iteration cycles, I learned to make the most of available feedback opportunities and to be efficient with the time I had. This experience taught me how to balance iterative development with real-world constraints and personal challenges."

      id: "professional",
      title: "Professional standard: Individually and in teams, you will apply a methodological approach used by the field to formulate project goals, involve stakeholders, conduct action-oriented research, advise, take decisions and report. In take into account ethical, intercultural and sustainable considerations.",
      explanation: "I demonstrated professional standards through my use of industry-standard tools and leadership approach. I used professional methods and teamwork techniques by using Visual Studio Code for programming and Figma for design work. As the team leader, I was in charge of managing team dynamics, presenting, and communicating with our client. I oversaw the majority of client contacts and presentations during the IMA project, making sure that our work was presented in an understandable and professional manner. Despite technical difficulties, I managed team meetings, assigned responsibilities, and kept the project moving forward. Clear communication, problem-solving, and team morale were the key focuses of my leadership style, especially during high-stress situations like the final presentation when we encountered technical difficulties. Positive comments from our client and professors confirmed this professional approach."

      id: "personal",
      title: "You are aware of your strengths and pitfalls, both in the field of ICT and in your personal development. You take actions in line with your core values to promote your personal growth and learning attitude.",
      explanation: "Personally, this semester has been quite difficult for me. Significant stress and time limits came from my grandmother's being hospitalized multiple times throughout my semester, my father's cancer operation, and other family circumstances. On top of the pressure added by the uncertainty and disappointments I experienced during my internship search, such as Prijsvrij Vakantie's last-minute cancellation. I'm really proud of what I've managed to accomplished in spite of these struggles. I led a team through a successful client project, maintained professional standards throughout, and produced a portfolio that accurately reflects my abilities and personality. Although i was thoroughly stresstested by my group and personal problems, I was able to adjust and keep going, this ended up allowing myself to deliver high-quality work even in difficult situations."

  process: "My semester journey has been marked by significant growth across all learning outcomes. Starting with the portfolio development, I learned to balance creativity with functionality, creating an engaging space theme while ensuring usability. The IMA Projects work pushed me to consider ethical implications and cultural sensitivity while developing technical solutions. The studio phase taught me about brand identity and team dynamics, while the final project phase tested my crisis management and professional conduct abilities. Each challenge, from technical issues to presentation setbacks, contributed to my development as a professional. The positive feedback from stakeholders, particularly IMA's interest in commercializing our solution, validates the semester's learning journey. Looking ahead, I'm better equipped to handle complex projects, work effectively in teams, and maintain professional standards under pressure.",
