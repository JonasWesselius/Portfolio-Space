  process: "Following our initial meeting via Teams, we met with Chloe, our client from IMA Projects, at the Simpelveld Asylum Seekers Center. We had the opportunity to meet our target audience face-to-face and were given a tour of the facility. Since we were able to prepare some interviews, we could gather opinions from as many people as possible, we conducted a total of seven interviews. We then had the opportunity to have a debriefing with our client. She was so impressed by our drive and work ethic that she even proposed that she might develop a viable business plan for our project. However, that is still a long way off. As it was time for us to return home after gathering information from the client and target audience.",
