        explanation: "I started with a basic mobile wireframe using the client's color palette and requirements (Moscow module). Each iteration became more playful and user-friendly, with improvements like a new navbar, a more prominent translation button, and a jobs-focused homepage. The final design incorporated our new branding and added a step-by-step guide page for refugees, including a progress bar to support their integration journey. This process demonstrates my ability to iterate on user feedback and business needs to create a validated, user-centered product."
      }
    ],
    process: "I began by creating a wireframe for a mobile page, as most of our target audience would access the product via mobile rather than PC. The first iteration was a simple design using the client's provided colors and was developed alongside a Moscow module for requirements. The next iteration introduced a more playful and stylized look, as well as a new navbar. In the following iteration, I updated the homepage and navbar, placing the jobs page at the center for easier access, and integrated the post button into the home screen. I also replaced the language flag with a more noticeable translation button. The final iteration featured our new branding and introduced a guide page for refugees, offering a step-by-step integration guide and a progress bar.",
