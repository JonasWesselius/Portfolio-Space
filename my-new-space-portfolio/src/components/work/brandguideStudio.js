  process: "The brand guide development began with extensive research into the studio's values, target audience, and competitive landscape. I started by creating mood boards and exploring different visual directions that could represent the studio's unique identity. After presenting several concepts to stakeholders, I refined the chosen direction into a comprehensive brand system. This included defining the color palette, typography, logo usage, and visual elements. I then documented all these elements in a detailed brand guide, ensuring that anyone working with the brand would have clear guidelines for maintaining consistency. The final phase involved creating examples of the brand applied across different mediums to demonstrate its versatility and impact.",
