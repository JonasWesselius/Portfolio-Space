      explanation: "The brand guide underwent multiple iterations in response to team requirements and feedback from teachers. We first considered a pink-focused concept based on the Dutch/Belgian girlgroup K3, but after receiving feedback, we changed our minds and decided to go with a boyband concept named 'The Frontyard Boys' that was inspired by Y2K. We were able to improve our concepts and produce a more unified brand identity thanks to this iterative process. With distinct links between design components and their use, each iteration improved on the one before it. I kept track of these changes to demonstrate how the brand identity changed over time and how each choice affected the final result."

In take into account ethical, intercultural and sustainable considerations.",
      explanation: "In order to ensure authenticity in our brand identity, I researched boyband culture and the Y2K era to guide our design choices. I thought about the ethical consequences of our choices and decided to change our original plan when it did not align with what we wanted to accomplish. The guide was made to be permanent, avoiding the need for frequent updates by serving as a long-term reference. It was my responsibility to specify the color scheme, limitations, and use cases for the logo. I made use of industry-standard professional tools such as Adobe Illustrator for vector-based typography and logo design, Adobe Photoshop for image editing and manipulation, and Figma for collaborative design work. These tools show my technical ability to produce high-quality design assets."

  process: "The process of developing our studio's brand identity started with the research of many ideas. At first, we thought of doing a parody of the well-known Dutch/Belgian female trio K3, focusing on pink. However, we were worried about coming off as unprofessional and the constraints of working just with pink after getting feedback to fully commit to this route. Our strategy changed as a result of this. We turned our attention to 'The Frontyard Boys,' a boyband concept inspired by Y2K. To assure authenticity in our design choices, this new direction required a new research of the Y2K era and boyband culture. We asked our lecturers for input after creating initial ideas, and they responded favorably to our Y2K-inspired guidance. This confirmation inspired us to improve our concepts even more. I concentrated on creating the color scheme and specifying the logo's use cases and limitations for the final version of the brand guide. In order to visually convey the aesthetic of our brand, I also made a stylescape. Together with moodboards, these components were used to produce a thorough brand guide that successfully conveys the essence of our studio.This process's iterative nature taught me the value of flexibility and responsiveness to feedback while keeping a clear vision for the end result.",
