My ability to develop modern, responsive web applications is demonstrated by this project. I now host images and other data externally using Vercel Blob Storage to effectively handle massive media assets. This ensures quick load times and keeps my repository small.",

    {
      id: "media-products",
      title: "You create engaging concepts and translate them into interactive validated media products by applying user-centered design principles, visual design techniques and by exploring emerging technologies.",
      explanation: "After getting inspiration from Dribbble.com, I focused on creating a dynamic and interactive portfolio instead of a static one. Based on feedback from teachers and a recruiter, I refined the animations to be less distracting while maintaining visual appeal. This iterative feedback process helped validate my design decisions and ensure the portfolio serves its purpose effectively."
    },
    {
      id: "process-documentation",
      title: "You explain and document your process, comment your code using version control in a personal and team context and communicate recommendations.",
      explanation: "I started early in the semester to avoid past experiences of rushing at the end. My process involved clear documentation from wireframes to mockups, incorporating feedback at each stage. Rather than creating new wireframes for minimal feedback, I efficiently integrated changes into the mockup phase, demonstrating adaptable documentation practices."
    },
    {
      id: "iterations",
      title: "You present the successive iterations of your creative process, and the connections between them.",
      explanation: "My iterative process started with wireframes that evolved into mockups based on teacher feedback. After receiving positive feedback on the mockups, I moved into development. When the initial version had too many fancy animations, feedback from both a recruiter and teacher led me to simplify the design, showing clear progression through each iteration."

In take into account ethical, intercultural and sustainable considerations.",
      explanation: "I demonstrated professional planning by starting early and considering both semester portfolio requirements and future internship applications. I actively sought and incorporated feedback from multiple stakeholders (teachers and a recruiter), and prioritized tasks effectively by focusing on content population before mobile optimization."

      explanation: "Learning from past experiences of poor planning, I deliberately started early this semester. I spent significant time on coding to ensure quality, showing commitment to improvement. When receiving feedback about busy animations and mobile considerations, I acknowledged these areas for improvement and took action to address them."

  process: "I started this semester with the task of creating a portfolio. This portfolio is meant to show off all the work I've done this semester and associate it with the correct learning outcomes. On top of that, I also have to start my internship next semester, so I need to have a portfolio to apply for internships as well. This is why I started as soon as possible on this task, since compared with experience from past semesters and having to rush it all at the end due to poor planning, I figured it would be nice to have my portfolio finished as soon as possible, and I can just add work into it as I go along the semester. I started with designing this portfolio in Figma. I always had static pages for my portfolio, so my goal here was to really make it dynamic. Make it interesting. After getting inspiration on Dribbble.com, I started creating wireframes that later, with the help of some feedback from teachers, transitioned into a mockup. The feedback on the wireframes was quite minimal, so instead of creating a new wireframe with the feedback, I decided to integrate the feedback into the next step instead. That being the mockup. When I showed off my mockup and shared my thoughts behind it, the feedback was really positive, and I almost instantly got the green light to start coding, so that's what I did next. I spent a long time coding this website because I wanted it to work properly and be something I can be proud of. After a month, I had mostly finished the website and asked for some feedback from a recruiter I know. He said he liked it, but it was very busy with all the fancy animations, so he suggested I tone those down. Also, he reminded me that most recruiters will be looking at this on mobile, so I need to keep that in mind as well. My teacher shared his thoughts and basically told me the same. I then changed the animations on home to be less distracting, and I'm still working on the mobile rendition of the website, but I've decided to focus on filling it with work first in regard to the portfolio review coming up. Initially, I stored all images and assets directly in the project repository. However, as the number and size of media files grew, this approach became unsustainable and slowed down development. To solve this, I migrated my images and large assets to Vercel Blob Storage. Now, I upload content to Vercel Blob Storage and use the generated URLs in my project. This keeps the repository size small, improves deployment speed, and ensures that media loads quickly for users.",
