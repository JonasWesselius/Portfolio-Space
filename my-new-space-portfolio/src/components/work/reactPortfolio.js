  description: "A React-built personal portfolio website that interactively and aesthetically displays my abilities and projects. My ability to develop modern, responsive web applications is demonstrated by this project. I now host images and other data externally using Vercel Blob Storage to effectively handle massive media assets. This ensures quick load times and keeps my repository small.",
  process: `The development of this portfolio followed a clear iterative process:

1. Initial Planning & Wireframing
I started by creating wireframes to establish the basic structure and navigation flow. These wireframes focused on creating an engaging space theme while maintaining usability. The initial designs explored different layouts for showcasing projects and learning outcomes.

2. First Iteration - Mockups
Based on the wireframes, I created high-fidelity mockups that incorporated the space theme more prominently. This iteration introduced the moon navigation concept and constellation-based project organization. I received feedback from teachers about the visual hierarchy and navigation clarity.

3. Second Iteration - Animation Refinement
After implementing the basic structure, I focused on animations and transitions. The initial version featured floating and shooting animations, but feedback from both teachers and a recruiter indicated they were too distracting. This led to the development of the more subtle star constellation design.

4. Final Iteration - Optimization
The final phase focused on performance optimization and mobile responsiveness. I implemented Vercel Blob Storage for media assets and refined the animations to ensure smooth performance across devices.`,

      id: "media-products",
      title: "You create engaging concepts and translate them into interactive validated media products by applying user-centered design principles, visual design techniques and by exploring emerging technologies.",
      explanation: "After getting inspiration from Dribbble.com, I focused on creating a dynamic and interactive portfolio instead of a static one. Based on feedback from teachers and a recruiter, I refined the animations to be less distracting while maintaining visual appeal. This iterative feedback process helped validate my design decisions and ensure the portfolio serves its purpose effectively."

    {
      id: "process-documentation",
      title: "You explain and document your process, comment your code using version control in a personal and team context and communicate recommendations.",
      explanation: "I started early in the semester to avoid past experiences of rushing at the end. My process involved clear documentation from wireframes to mockups, incorporating feedback at each stage. Rather than creating new wireframes for minimal feedback, I efficiently integrated changes into the mockup phase, demonstrating adaptable documentation practices."
    },
    {
      id: "iterations",
      title: "You present the successive iterations of your creative process, and the connections between them.",
      explanation: "The portfolio development followed a clear iterative process, starting with wireframes that evolved into mockups based on teacher feedback. After receiving positive feedback on the mockups, I moved into development. When the initial version had too many fancy animations, feedback from both a recruiter and teacher led me to simplify the design. Each iteration built upon the previous one, with clear connections between design decisions and user feedback. The final version successfully balances visual appeal with usability, demonstrating the value of iterative development."

In take into account ethical, intercultural and sustainable considerations.",
      explanation: "I demonstrated professional planning by starting early and considering both semester portfolio requirements and future internship applications. I actively sought and incorporated feedback from multiple stakeholders (teachers and a recruiter), and prioritized tasks effectively by focusing on content population before mobile optimization."

      id: "personal",
      title: "You are aware of your strengths and pitfalls, both in the field of ICT and in your personal development. You take actions in line with your core values to promote your personal growth and learning attitude.",
      explanation: "Learning from past experiences of poor planning, I deliberately started early this semester. I spent significant time on coding to ensure quality, showing commitment to improvement. When receiving feedback about busy animations and mobile considerations, I acknowledged these areas for improvement and took action to address them."
