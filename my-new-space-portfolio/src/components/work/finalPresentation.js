  process: "Unexpected difficulties arose the day before the last presentation when a teammate's contribution, which was only meant to change two files, broke the application and affected 58 files. After spending a lot of time resolving these problems, I had to deal with another unexpected commit just thirty minutes prior to our presentation, which broke it again. Despite these obstacles, our team worked together swiftly to fix the mistakes, which caused a 15-minute delay in our presentation to Chloe. Luca covered the database and account components, while I did the majority of the presentation and demonstration.  The presentation was favorably welcomed even though it wasn't perfect. Chloe requested a summary presentation for their marketing team after being impressed with our progress and expressing interest in turning the project into a business. Several teachers stopped by our presentation during the morning to give us praise for our work and to provide special recognition to those who stayed to continue presenting. The teachers valued the independence and commitment displayed by the team members who stayed, even though some of us left early.",
