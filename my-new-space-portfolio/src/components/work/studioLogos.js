  learningOutcome: "With this work, I developed experience in collaborative logo design and brand identity evolution.

      explanation: "The logo design evolved significantly through our team's creative process, starting with a K3-inspired concept and transitioning to a Y2K boyband aesthetic. Each team member created their own version of the logo for both themes, showing multiple iterations. The final design was chosen through team voting, and further refined into a condensed version for icons, demonstrating clear progression in our design thinking."

      explanation: "Working as part of a studio team, I demonstrated professional collaboration through participating in brainstorming sessions, creating multiple logo versions, and engaging in group decision-making. When the brand direction shifted from K3-inspired to Y2K boyband aesthetic, I adapted professionally to the new requirements and contributed to the voting process, showing flexibility and team-oriented thinking."

  process: "Following our brainstorming session during the studio design process, we ultimately decided to parody the Dutch/Belgian girl group K3. Therefore, we needed a logo. We came to the conclusion that it would be ideal if each person created their own rendition of the logo. Later, we decided to change the identity to a less pink and more plausible boyband vibe inspired by Y2K. As a result, everyone had to update their logos to reflect the new brand. We debated and elaborated for a while before voting on the best version, which was a different group member's logo. One variation of this was a condensed form for icons and other materials that only included the initials.",
