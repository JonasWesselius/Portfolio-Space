  process:"When my brother complained about his existing website, which was made by a professional studio, the work got underway. He requested that I look it over and make any necessary changes. After evaluating the functionality and needs of the current website, I created a new version with React components to improve maintainability. Since the majority of clients access the website on mobile devices, I placed a lot of emphasis on responsive design. The design enhanced the user experience while preserving the orange and brown color palette of his company. My brother was quite happy with the outcome when I showed him the fully operational website after deployment on Vercel, and he is currently talking with his wife about the next stages.",
