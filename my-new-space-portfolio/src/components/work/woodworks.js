  ],process: "When my brother complained about his existing website, which was made by a professional studio, the work got underway. He requested that I look it over and make any necessary changes. After evaluating the functionality and needs of the current website, I created a new version with React components to improve maintainability. Since the majority of clients access the website on mobile devices, I placed a lot of emphasis on responsive design. The design enhanced the user experience while preserving the orange and brown color palette of his company. After deploying the fully operational website on Vercel, I conducted a user test with the owner, giving him three tasks to complete. He was able to complete all tasks successfully, confirming the structure and navigation are effective. Based on his feedback, I will improve the visibility of the form text and make the services page clickable in the navigation, as well as add more images of his actual work before going live.",
