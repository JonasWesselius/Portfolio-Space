      explanation: "After reviewing multiple client presentations, I took the initiative to document our team's motivation for choosing the boardgame project.

The team's agreement with my writing demonstrated effective stakeholder communication."

  process:"We received a few presentations of various clients and their projects at the end of the studio phase. Following the conclusion of these presentations, we were required to present the motivations behind our first and second choices. Maikel and Petra's boardgame project was our first pick. I was in charge of drafting this motivation, so I went back and reviewed the presentation and noted any points that really stood out to us. and why their project would be most suitable for our studio. I showed my motivational writing to the team once I was done, and they all agreed with it. Later, I turned it from a dull Word document into a polished PDF by using our brandstyle.",
