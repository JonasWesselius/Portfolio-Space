  process: "The poster design process began with analyzing the research findings and identifying key messages to communicate. I created initial sketches exploring different layout options and visual approaches. After gathering feedback, I refined the design through multiple iterations, focusing on creating a clear visual hierarchy and ensuring information was presented in a logical flow. I carefully selected typography, colors, and visual elements to support the content and enhance understanding. The final phase involved preparing the poster for printing and developing a presentation script to guide viewers through the content.",
