  learningOutcome: "Making this poster presentation helped me hone my ability to condense intricate research results into an understandable and visually appealing style. I gained knowledge on how to organize data in a hierarchical manner, showcase important ideas with visuals, and create a coherent story that leads the audience through the findings and methodology of our research.",

      id: "media-products",
      title: "You create engaging concepts and translate them into interactive validated media products by applying user-centered design principles, visual design techniques and by exploring emerging technologies.",
      explanation: "I created a poster design that effectively communicated our research findings and personas, incorporating our studio's branding elements (Frontyard Boys). While my initial design focused on stakeholder communication, I later contributed to improving the chosen design by optimizing it for A2 dimensions, enhancing image quality, and refining spatial symmetry."

      id: "iterations",
      title: "You present the successive iterations of your creative process, and the connections between them.",
      explanation: "The poster went through several iterations within our team, starting with individual designs (including my own version), followed by a voting process, and finally evolving through refinements of the chosen design. I contributed to the final iteration by improving technical aspects such as dimensions, spacing, and image quality while maintaining the core concept."

      id: "professional",
      title: "Professional standard: Individually and in teams, you will apply a methodological approach used by the field to formulate project goals, involve stakeholders, conduct action-oriented research, advise, take decisions and report. In take into account ethical, intercultural and sustainable considerations.",
      explanation: "Working as part of the Frontyard Boys studio, I demonstrated professional teamwork through participating in the design voting process and accepting feedback from teachers. When another design was chosen, I professionally contributed my technical skills to improve the final product rather than advocating for my own design, showing adaptability and commitment to team success."

  ],
  process: "The poster design process began with analyzing the research findings and personas and identifying key messages to communicate. I created my own version of what I thought would be important to showcase to the stakeholders, focusing on creating a clear visual hierarchy and ensuring information was presented in a logical flow. I used typography, colors, and visual elements in line with our studio branding to show off that this work was done by the Frontyard Boys. After everyone had created their poster, it was time to vote. At first we voted for Lucas' poster to win, but after someone else went to the teacher and showed their poster, the teacher said it was perfect, so we ended up choosing that one. I altered his design to fit the dimensions of A2, adjusted his spacing to be more symmetrical, and replaced his images to be of higher quality. The final phase involved preparing the poster for printing and cutting it to the right size.",
