  description: "We had the opportunity to go to the Art Department with our entire class, I decided it would be best for me not to go since I had to take care of dad who just had surgery to get his cancer removed. He suggested I should go but I deemed it not necessary for my personal development as a front-end developer. So all in all it made the choice easy for me to stay home that day and not attend the Art Department.",
