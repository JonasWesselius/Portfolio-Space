  process: "As the technical lead for the ReFuture PWA, I started by setting up the React project and initializing the GitHub repository. I taught my team how to install Node.js, run the app locally, and use GitHub Desktop for version control. I divided the project into components and assigned tasks so everyone could work simultaneously. To ensure smooth collaboration, I demonstrated how to create branches, make pull requests, squash and merge changes, and write clear commit messages. This approach helped us avoid merge conflicts and kept our codebase organized.",
