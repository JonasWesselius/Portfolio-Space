      explanation: "The personas went through multiple iterations based on interview findings. Each iteration refined the user characteristics and pain points, with clear connections to specific interview insights. For example, the BSN requirement emerged as a common barrier across interviews, leading to its inclusion as a key challenge in relevant personas."

      explanation: "The interview process demonstrated professional research methodology, ensuring ethical considerations and cultural sensitivity. I carefully documented the diverse perspectives of asylum seekers from different countries, considering their unique cultural backgrounds and experiences while maintaining confidentiality and respect."
    }
  ],
  process: "The persona development process began with conducting in-depth interviews with six diverse asylum seekers from different countries (Iran, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Sudan, Syria, and Turkey). These interviews revealed common themes and unique challenges in their job search journeys. Key findings included language barriers, BSN requirements, CV creation difficulties, and transportation issues. I analyzed these interviews to identify patterns in their experiences, needs, and aspirations. Based on this research, I developed detailed personas that represent different segments of the target audience, each with distinct characteristics, challenges, and goals. The personas were refined through multiple iterations, incorporating feedback from stakeholders and ensuring they accurately represented the diverse experiences uncovered in the interviews.",
