      title: "You present the successive iterations of your creative process, and the connections between them.",
      explanation:"Based on the results of the interviews, the personas underwent some iterations. With distinct links to certain interview insights, each iteration improved the user's traits and problems. For instance, the BSN requirement was mentioned as a major problem in the target audience since it was found to be a prevalent obstacle in interviews. Things like relationship status and work experience turned out to be less useful than time spent in the Netherlands and languages, for example."

      explanation:"Throughout the interview process, professional methodology was shown while upholding ethical and cultural awareness. I created the questions such that the target audience would not be offended or hurt in order to maintain anonymity and respect. Since they find this to be such a sensitive subject."

  process: "Making what I believed to be the stereotypical asylum seeker was the first step in developing the persona. Since I felt it would be interesting to compare my perception of the target audience with the actual personas resulting from the interviews we were going to do later, I used all of my personal knowledge and experience to create this. We had in-depth interviews with seven different asylum applicants from Iran, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Sudan, Syria, and Turkey after I completed my own persona. These interviews uncovered recurring themes and particular difficulties they faced when looking for work. Language barriers, BSN requirements, CV building difficulties, and transportation constraints were among the main results. In order to find trends in their needs, goals, and experiences, I examined these interviews. I created comprehensive personas based on this study that reflect many target audience segments, each with unique traits, difficulties, and objectives. The stakeholder has been sent these personas, and we are now expecting their feedback.",
